# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Black Background Frontend

A modern, sleek fraud detection web application with a black background interface.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Model
First, make sure your Jupyter notebook has been run to generate the trained model:
- Run all cells in `CredFrad.ipynb`
- This will create `credit_card_model.pkl` in the same directory

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5000**

## Features

✨ **Modern Black Background UI**
- Sleek dark theme with cyan accents
- Responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- Real-time fraud prediction

🔍 **Single Transaction Analysis**
- Enter transaction features and get instant fraud detection
- See confidence scores
- Real-time predictions

📊 **Batch CSV Processing**
- Upload entire CSV files
- Get statistics on fraud rates
- Process multiple transactions at once

🎯 **Model Integration**
- Pre-trained Logistic Regression model
- 95% training accuracy
- 91.3% test accuracy

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/predict` - Single transaction prediction
- `POST /api/predict-batch` - Batch CSV processing
- `GET /api/model-info` - Get model statistics

## Input Features (for single predictions)

- **Time**: Transaction time in seconds (0-172800)
- **V1-V28**: PCA-transformed features from the dataset
- **Amount**: Transaction amount in dollars

## Troubleshooting

**"Model not loaded" error:**
- Make sure `credit_card_model.pkl` exists in the same directory
- Run all cells in `CredFrad.ipynb` to generate the model file

**Port already in use:**
- Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`

**Module not found errors:**
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
